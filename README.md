# Code

The code is tested on 
- Python 3.7.8, TensorFlow 2.3.1, TensorFlow Probability 0.11.1
- Python 3.6.9, TensorFlow 2.6.0, TensorFlow Probability 0.14.0 (on GPU from `Dockerfile`)

## Run scripts 

Run `python demo.py` to start training a variational wavefunction for the minimal BMN model. 
Change parameters `N`, `l` in `demo.py` for different matrix sizes and couplings, `alpha` for different hidden-to-visible ratios in block autoregressive flows.

Run `python bosonic.py` to start training a variational wavefunction for the bosonic part of the minimal BMN model. Same parameters apply.

## Docker

A `Dockerfile` is provided for running the code inside a container when a NVidia GPU is available.
Build the container with `docker build -t <your-image-name> .` and then run it with `docker run --rm --gpus all -it -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir <your-image-name>`.
This will open a terminal inside the container with a prompt inside this repository's folder (called `/workdir` inside the container).
From this terminal you can run the code as described in [Run scripts](#run-scripts).
